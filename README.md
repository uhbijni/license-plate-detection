# License Plate Detection Project

This project implements a license plate detection system using computer vision techniques. It is designed to detect and annotate license plates in images.

```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the license plate detection application, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py <path_to_image>
```

Replace `<path_to_image>` with the path to the image file you want to process.

## License Plate Detection Algorithm

The license plate detection system uses a pre-trained model to identify and locate license plates in images. The main components of the system include:

- **Model Loading**: The system loads a pre-trained model for license plate detection.
- **Image Processing**: Input images are preprocessed to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Plate Detection**: The system detects license plates and annotates them on the original image.
